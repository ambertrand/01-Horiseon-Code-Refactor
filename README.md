# 01-Horiseon-Code-Refactor

For this request I was tasked with refactoring the code for a client Web application.  This included altering the HTML to have semantic elements and consolidating the CSS properties to follow the HTML semantic structure.

I started out by looking throught the HTML to replace any non-semantic elements.  This then lead me to consolidate some of the structure of the semantic elements.  Once I thought I had consolidated the HTML I realized there needed to be a lot done to the CSS to also consolidate multiple similar selectors.  I found this to be the hardest part of the project because it took many tries to fix the application back to it's original appearance.  This definitely tested my patience but overtime I was able to solve it the issues and successfully consolidate the CSS selectors and properties.

Refactored Code
* Edited the application title
* Changed HTML to have Semantic elements & follow structure
* Added accessible alt attributes to all images
* Consolicated & organized CSS selectors and properties
* Made sure all links functioned properly
